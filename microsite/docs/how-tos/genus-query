# Query The Genus Node

The Genus node provides a query mode to query the UXTOs of a given address. 

## Query UXTO by address

To query UXTOs by address run the following command:

```bash
brambl-cli genus-query utxo-by-address --from-party $PARTY --from-contract $CONTRACT -h $HOST --bifrost-port $PORT --walletdb $WALLET
```

This will query the UXTOs for the address in the genus node. It uses the wallet to derive the right address to query.
